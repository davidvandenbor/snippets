# CSS animated background image
For some weird reason, CSS animations don't work when you try to animate CSS background images declared on the BODY element. So, in order for the animation to work, we'll move the CSS background image to a separate HTML element, like a ``SECTION`` or a ``DIV``. The reason for the ``.background-wrapper container`` is to prevent scrollbars from appearing when the background animates (overflow:hidden)
