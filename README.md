# Snippets bin

My snippets bin with  handy initial fragments of code examples. If a snippet grows in complexity or "graduates" in importance, I'll migrate it to my [Playgrounds](https://davidvandenbor.github.io/playgrounds/) repo, where snippets get their own **sandbox** (to play with or preview the code) ðŸ˜Š

So the official snippets library Playground is [here](https://davidvandenbor.github.io/playgrounds/)
